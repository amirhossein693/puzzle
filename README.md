## Getting Started
This package requires Grunt, Ruby, Sass, and Compass >=1.0.1 installed

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may setup the package with this command:

```shell
grunt build
```

And you'll need the latest version of [Compass](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-compass#compass-task):

```shell
gem update --system && gem install compass --pre
```

Clone the project, Install grunt modules and run the 'build' task.
Enjoy it.

Also you can use 'serve' task for Developing mode
